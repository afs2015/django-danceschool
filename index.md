Partnered social dance schools are complicated. We run regular class
series in all sorts of different configurations, which may require
prerequisites, auditions, complex pricing, etc. We also often run public
events, some of which require registration, and some of which do not. We
often manage numerous instructors, teach in numerous locations, and have
to manage schedules and finances for all of these things.

At the same time, partnered social dance schools are often run by
amateurs, with limited time and resources. The founders of this project
are all Lindy Hoppers, and in that community, even many of the most
prominent and successful dance schools have zero full-time staff. We
have seen many instances of schools that are simply unable to grow or
expand their reach, because they lack the time and resources to manage
all of the logistical details. Those constraints are a disservice to the
dance.

Over a period of several years, in Boston, we have sought to address
these issues by building our own custom registration system, complete
with all of the features needed to run a sophisticated dance school.
Surprisingly, the commercial options for dance schools are very limited,
inflexible, and often expensive. We ended up with software that suits
our needs well, but that is also adaptable enough to be suited to a wide
range of dance schools, including partnered social dances of all types,
but also to many other types of dance. This project is the result of
those efforts.
