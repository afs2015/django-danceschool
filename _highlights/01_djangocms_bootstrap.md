The sophisticated [django CMS](https://www.django-cms.org/) system handles your front-end content and allows you or your staff to manage your website's content without knowledge of HTML.  It includes features such as front-end content editing, drafts, and sophisticated plugin features that make it simple to keep your school's site polished.

Customizing your site's layout can be a pain, but Django Dance School is built to use the popular [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) library, so you can get your own designs up and running quickly.
